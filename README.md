This is a from scratch implementation of the reftable format for
storing Git ref and reflog data.

The spec is at
https://eclipse.googlesource.com/jgit/jgit/+/refs/heads/master/Documentation/technical/reftable.md

Based on the implementation, there is also [a proposal for a v2 of the
format](reftable-v2-proposal.md).


# Java

Reftable was originally implemented in JGit, and can be considered the reference
implementation.  The code has two parts:

*   The format itself:
    https://eclipse.googlesource.com/jgit/jgit/+/master/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable

*   The layout within a local disk repository: https://gerrit.googlesource.com/jgit/+/master/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileReftableStack.java

# GO

The Go implementation implements the spec completely.
[API doc](https://godoc.org/github.com/google/reftable).

# C

An experimental implementation in C is under the directory c/ . It is
functionally equivalent to the Go version. Build and test it using

```
bazel test c/...
```

API is documented in side the [reftable.h
header](https://github.com/google/reftable/blob/master/c/include/reftable.h).

It includes a fragment of the zlib library to provide uncompress2(), which is a
recent addition to the API. zlib is licensed as follows:
